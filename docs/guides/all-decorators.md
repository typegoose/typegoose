This Page shows all the decorators that can be used for / in a class.

- All Property decorators:
  - [`@prop`](api/decorators/prop.md) is the most important decorator, because it defines values(\|keys) that are then in the model & document.
<!--This is just a separator-->
- All Class decorators:
  - [`@modelOptions`](api/decorators/modelOptions.md), used for Schema Options, an existing Mongoose and an existing Connection
  - [`@index`](api/decorators/indexes.md) is for indexes, that are **NOT** defined in the prop (mainly for compound indexes)
  - [`@plugin`](api/decorators/plugins.md) is for adding plugins. Please note that plugins cannot modify the types of prop.
  - [`@queryMethod`](api/decorators/queryMethod.md) is for adding custom query Methods.
  - [Hooks](api/decorators/hooks.md):
    - `@pre` is for Pre-Hooks.
    - `@post` is for Post-Hooks.
