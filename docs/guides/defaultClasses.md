This Guide contains all default classes Typegoose provides.

:::note
All properties provided are just types to show which are available from Mongoose, or stated otherwise.

### TimeStamps

The `TimeStamps` class provides the following fields:

- `createdAt`: Date
- `updatedAt`: Date

### Base

The Base Class provides the following fields:

- `_id`: ObjectId
- `__v`: number
- `__t`: undefined \| string \| number

How to override `_id` type:  
<sub>This only works with typegoose 6.0.2+</sub>

```ts
class Something extends Base<mongoose.Schema.Type.String> {} // _id is now of type "String" (from mongoose)
```

### FindOrCreate

This class provides all the types supplied by the plugin `mongoose-findOrCreate`.

:::note
This class should only be used, if the plugin is used too
:::

[An Example can be seen in common-plugins](guides/advanced/common-plugins.md#mongoose-findorcreate)

## Extra information

Here you can find extra information.

### Use multiple classes together

Because Typescript & JavaScript don't have functions for multiple inheritance, it can only be achieved by the following

```ts
interface Something extends Base {} // have the interface to add the types of "Base" to the class
class Something extends TimeStamps {} // have your class
```

:::note
This only works because `Base` only has types and does not modify anything.
