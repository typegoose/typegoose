## Errors

### Mongoose Version [E001]

Error: `Please use mongoose 8.1.0 or higher (Current mongoose: x.x.x) [E001]`

Error Class: `Error`

Details:  
Typegoose requires at least the mentioned mongoose version because that version was validated for that version of typegoose, previous / newer mongoose versions may have functional or type changes which are incompatible with the currently installed typegoose version.

[Mongoose Compatability](../guides/mongoose-compatibility.md)

### NodeJS Version [E002]

Error: `You are using a NodeJS Version below 14.17.0, Please Upgrade! [E002]`

Error Class: `Error`

Details:  
Typegoose requires at least NodeJS Version 14.17, because:

- it is the lowest LTS version, which many (dev) dependencies already require

### Function only supports to be called "${supported}" times [E003]

Error:

```txt
Function "${functionName}" only supports to be called "${supported}" times with the same parameters [E003]
${extra}
```

Error Class: `FunctionCalledMoreThanSupportedError`

Details:  
For example [`addModelToTypegoose`](../api/functions/addModelToTypegoose.md) only supports to be called once (1) with the same model name, [this problem has a specific Guide](./advanced/models-with-same-name.mdx).

### Self Containing Class [E004]

Error:

```txt
It seems like the type used is the same as the target class, which is not supported (${name}.${key}) [E004]
```

Error Class: `SelfContainingClassError`

Details:  
Because of limitations in JavaScript, it is not possible to use a self-containing-classes, but self-referencing still works  

Example:

```ts
class Cat {
  @prop()
  public kitten: Cat[]; // self-containing-class

  // the above will "de-sugar" to
  @prop({ type: Cat }) // self-containing-class
  public kitten: Cat[];
}

class Cat {
  @prop({ ref: () => Cat })
  public kitten: Ref<Cat>[]; // not self-containing class
}
```

### ref is undefined [E005]

Error: `Prop-Option "ref"'s value is "null" or "undefined" for "${name}.${key}" [E005]`

Error Class: `RefOptionIsUndefinedError`

Details:  
Either:
- The Option `ref` was defined with a function, but that function returned `undefined / null`
- The Option `ref` was defined with `undefined / null` (`{ ref: undefined }`) ([Can Be Solved with this guide](./advanced/reference-other-classes.md#common-problems))

Example of when this gets triggered:

```ts
class ErrorClass {
  @prop({ ref: () => undefined }) // <- error here
  public someProp?: Ref<ErrorClass>;

  @prop({ ref: undefined }) // <- error here
  public someProp?: Ref<ErrorClass>;
}
```

### Not All Virtual Populate Elements Provided [E006]

Error: `${name}.${key}" has not all needed Virtual Populate Options! Needed are: ${allVirtualoptions.join(', ')} [E006]`

Error Class: `NotAllVPOPElementsError`

Details:  
Not all required Virtual-Populate options were provided, required are: `localField, foreignField, ref`

### Get & Set Options [E007]

<span class="badge badge--warning">This Error got removed in 9.0.0</span>

Error:
- `"${name}.${key}" does not have a set function! [E007]`
- `"${name}.${key}" does not have a get function! [E007]`

Error Class: [`TypeError`](https://github.com/typegoose/typegoose/blob/8fad2ac213a953579a4eeaa236951a57fb12855f/src/internal/processProp.ts#L182-L183)

Details:  
When using the `get & set` options, both are required to be specified at the same time

### refPath must be of type String [E008]

<span class="badge badge--warning">This Error got removed in 9.0.0</span>

:::info
This Error got merged with [`E026`](#expected-string-to-have-length-e026) in 9.0.0
:::

Error: `"refPath" for "${name}, ${key}" should be of type String! [E008]`

Error Class: [`TypeError`](https://github.com/typegoose/typegoose/blob/8fad2ac213a953579a4eeaa236951a57fb12855f/src/internal/processProp.ts#L260)

Details:  
The Option `refPath` needs to be defined as a string (mongoose limitation, typegoose check)

### Invalid Type [E009]

Error: `"${targetName}.${key}"'s Type is invalid! Type is: "${Type}" [E009]`

Error Class: `InvalidTypeError`

Details:  
The `Type` in its final state (after checking `rawOptions.type` and executing the deferring-function) is either `undefined / null` or not being a function

Example of when this gets triggered:

```ts
enum TestEnum {}

class ErrorClass {
  @prop({ type: () => undefined }) // <- error here, correct type: "String"
  public someProp?: string;

  @prop({ type: 'Hello' }) // <- error here, correct type: "String"
  public someProp?: string;

  @prop({ type: TestEnum }) // <- error here, correct type: "String"
  public someProp?: TestEnum
}
```

### Not String Type Error (Enum) [E010]

Error:

```txt
Typeof "${targetName}.${key}" is "String", used enum is not only Strings! [E010]
  Encountered with property in Enum: ${enumKey}.${typeof enumValue}
```

Error Class: `NotStringTypeError`

Details:  
This Error should never be thrown if Typescript is used, it throws if the `Type` is `String` and an `enum`(option) is provided, but the enum is not *only consisting* of strings

### Not Number Type Error (Enum) [E011]

Error:

```txt
Typeof "${targetName}.${key}" is "Number", value is undefined/null or does not have a reverse mapping! [E011]
  Encountered with property: ${enumKey}.${typeof enumValue}
```

Error Class: `NotNumberTypeError`

Details:  
This Error should never be thrown if Typescript is used, it throws if the `Type` is `Number` and an `enum`(option) is provided, but the enum is not *only consisting* of numbers (checked by the reverse mapping)

### Invalid Type for Enum [E012]

Error:

```txt
Invalid Type used for options "enum" at "${name}.${key}"! [E012]
Type: "${toStringNoFail(value)}"
https://typegoose.github.io/typegoose/docs/guides/error-warning-details#invalid-type-for-enum-e012
```

Error Class: `InvalidEnumTypeError`

Details:  
This Error may get thrown when a invalid Type is used with the option [`enum`](../api/decorators/prop.md#enum).
Currently Valid Types for enum are `String` or `Number`.

This may be thrown when using typescript option `transpileOnly` (see [Known Issues: transpile-only](./known-issues.md#transpile-only)) or using Babel without proper configuration (see [Known Issues: Babel](./known-issues.md#babel)).

:::tip
This Error has a workaround, see [Use Without "emitDecoratorMetadata"](./use-without-emitDecoratorMetadata.md).

### Invalid PropType used [E013]

Error: `"${proptype}"(${where}) is invalid for "${name}.${key}" [E013]`

Error Class: `InvalidPropTypeError`

Details:  
The Value `${proptype}` is not supported in `${where}` or does not exist in the [`PropType`](../api/decorators/prop.md#proptype) enum.

### Input was not string or have .typegooseName function/string [E014]

Error:

```txt
Input was not a string AND didn't have a .typegooseName function AND didn't have a .typegooseName string [E014]
Value: "${toStringNoFail(input)}"
```

Error Class: `ResolveTypegooseNameError`

Details:  
The Provided Input `input` was not a string and didn't have a `.typegooseName` function / string to be searched by.

### customName must be string and at least one character [E015]

<span class="badge badge--warning">This Error got removed in 9.0.0</span>

:::info
This Error got merged with [`E026`](#expected-string-to-have-length-e026) in 9.0.0
:::

Error: `"customName" must be a string AND at least one character ("${baseName}") [E015]`

Error Class: [`TypeError`](https://github.com/typegoose/typegoose/blob/8fad2ac213a953579a4eeaa236951a57fb12855f/src/internal/utils.ts#L342)

Details:  
The `customName` option must be a String AND at least *one* character long

### Type doesn't have "OptionsConstructor" [E016]

Error:

```txt
Type has a invalid "OptionsConstructor" on "${name}.${key}"! [E016]
Type: "${toStringNoFail(type)}"
```

Error Class: `InvalidOptionsConstructor`

Details:  
The Type provided `type` does not have a `OptionsConstructor` property, this property is required to map options correctly.

Typegoose uses the property [`OptionsConstructor`](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose/tree/master/lib/options) on types (like `mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId.OptionsConstructor`) to correctly map the options (from `@prop(options)`) to the appropriate place.

If custom types are used and they don't have `OptionsConstructor`, and an easy way to workaround this error is the following:

```ts
mongoose.Schema.Types.Custom.OptionsConstructor = {}; // only do this if really necessary
mongoose.Schema.Types.Custom.OptionsConstructor = mongoose.SchemaTypeOptions; // prefer this if possible
```

### Setting "Mixed" is not allowed [E017]

Error: `Setting "Mixed" is not allowed! (${name}, ${key}) [E017]`

Error Class: `TypeError`

Details:  
The option to change Severity is set to `Severity.ERROR`  

The Severity can be set:
- Globally with [`setGlobalOptions`](../api/functions/setGlobalOptions.md).
- Class-wide with [`modelOptions`](../api/decorators/modelOptions.md#allowmixed).
- Property-Specific with [`allowMixed`](../api/decorators/prop.md#allowmixed).

### dim needs to be 1 or higher [E018]

Error: `"dim" needs to be higher than 0 (${name}.${key}) [E018]`

Error Class: `RangeError`

Details:  
The Option `dim` must be at least 1 or higher, because an array with 0 (or less) dimensions is not possible

### Assertion Error [E019]

Error: `Assert failed - no custom error [E019]`

Error Class: `AssertionFallbackError`

Details:  
This Error should never show up, if it does report it

### PropOptions.discriminators doesn't support Arrays with more or less than 1 dimension [E020]

<span class="badge badge--warning">This Error got removed in 9.4.0</span>

:::info
This Error got merged with [`E027`](#the-option-does-not-support-a-option-value-e027) in 9.4.0
:::

Error: `"PropOptions.discriminators" doesn't support Arrays higher and lower than 1 (got "${gotType.dim}" dimensions at "${name}.${key}") [E020]`

Error Class: `Error`

Details:  
Somewhere the option `discriminators` was defined with an array which had more or less than 1 dimension

Example of when this gets triggered:

```ts
class ErrorClass {
  @prop({ discriminators: () => [[ErrorClass]] }) // <- error here
  public someProp?: ErrorClass; // (this is just an example)

  @prop({ discriminators: () => ErrorClass }) // <- error here
  public someProp?: ErrorClass; // (this is just an example)
}
```

:::

Error: `Prop-Option "ref" does not support Arrays! (got "${dim}" dimensions, for property "${name}.${key}") [E021]`

Error Class: `OptionRefDoesNotSupportArraysError`

Details:  
Somewhere the option `ref` was defined with an array, which is not supported

Example of when this gets triggered:

```ts
class ErrorClass {
  @prop({ ref: () => [ErrorClass] }) // <- error here
  public someProp?: Ref<ErrorClass>;
}
```

Details:  
The option `ref` / `refPath` are not supported for this `propKind` (which in most cases is `MAP`)

### A property key in Typegoose cannot be an symbol! [E024]

Error: `A property key in Typegoose cannot be an symbol! (${name}.${String(key)}) [E024]`

Error Class: `CannotBeSymbolError`

Details:  
A Property Key in Typegoose cannot be a Symbol, it must be a String (also a limitation of mongoose)

### Expected "${where}" to be a valid mongoose.Model! [E025]

Error: `Expected "${where}" to be a valid mongoose.Model! (got: "${model}") [E025]`

Error Class: `StringLengthExpectedError`

Details:  
Expected `valueName` to be a String and have at least the length of `length`, but got length / value `got` at `where`.

This Error gets most commonly thrown when:

- [`customName`](../api/decorators/modelOptions.md#customname) is a Function, but the function does not return a String or the returned String does not have the required length.
- [`customName`](../api/decorators/modelOptions.md#customname) is defined, but is not a String or the defined String does not have the required length.
- [`refPath`](../api/decorators/prop.md#refpath) is defined, but is not a String or the defined String does not have the required length.

### The Option does not support a Option Value [E027]

Error: `The Option "${currentOption}" does not support Option "${problemOption}" other than "${expected}" (provided was: "${provided}") [E027]`

Error Class: `OptionDoesNotSupportOption`

Details:  
The Option `currentOption` does not support the value `provided` that was set for `problemOption`, expected value was `expected`.

This Error gets most commonly thrown when:

- Option `discriminators`'s function return value is not a array.
- Option `discriminators`' function return value is a multi-layer array.
- Option `ref`'s value or function return value is a array.

Example of when this gets triggered:

```ts

  @prop({ discriminators: () => [[ErrorClass]] }) // <- error here
  public someProp?: ErrorClass; // (this is just an example)

  @prop({ discriminators: () => ErrorClass }) // <- error here
  public someProp?: ErrorClass; // (this is just an example)

Example of when this gets triggered:

```ts
getModelForClass(undefined); // first argument is the class
getDiscriminatorModelForClass(ParentModel, undefined); // second argument is the class
addModelToTypegoose("ModelName", ModelSchema, undefined); // third argument is the class
buildSchema(undefined); // first argument is the class
deleteModelWithClass(undefined); // first argument is the class
getName(undefined); // first argument is the class

Example of when this gets triggered:

```ts
setGlobalOptions(undefined); // Expected input(name of first argument) to be a defined object
deleteModel(undefined); // Expected name(name of first argument) to be a string
getModelWithString(undefined); // Expected key(name of first argument) to be a string

@pre('', undefined) // Expected fn(name of second argument) to be a function
@post('', undefined) // Expected fn(name of second argument) to be a function
class SomeClass {}

@pre('', () => {}, '')) // Expected options(name of third argument) to be a object or undefined
@post('', () => {}, '') // Expected options(name of third argument) to be a object or undefined
class SomeClass {}
```

### Path does not exist on Schema [E030]

Error: `Path "${key}" on "${name}" does not exist in the Schema! [E030]`

Error Class: `PathNotInSchemaError`

Details:

:::

### Duplicate Option Definition [E032]

Error: `Duplicate Option definition at [${duplicateAt.join(',')}] [E032]`

Error Class: `DuplicateOptionsError`

Details:  
The options at `duplicateAt` are defined, but only one can be used.

This Error gets most commonly thrown when:

- When option `discriminators` is defined both as a prop-option and as a model-option.

This Error can be fixed by only defining one of the mention options.

### Cache Disabled [E033]

Error: `Tried using cache, but was disabled at "${where}" [E033]`

Error Class: `CacheDisabledError`

Details:  
Tried using a function (`where`) that required cache, but cache was disabled.

## Warnings

### Type is not ${type}, but includes the following ${extra} options [W001]

Warning:

```txt
Type of "${name}.${key}" is not ${type}, but includes the following ${extra} options [W001]:
  [${included.join(', ')}]
```

Details:  
The provided options (listed in the warning) do nothing with the provided `Type`

### Property was defined differently on base and discriminator [W002]

Warning:

```txt
Property "${property}" was defined on "${clName}", but is different from discriminator base "${fromName}", which is not supported! [W002]
```

Details:  
The Property [`existingConnection`](../api/decorators/modelOptions.md#existingconnection) or [`existingMongoose`](../api/decorators/modelOptions.md#existingmongoose) were defined differently on the discriminator's base model and the discriminator itself, which is not supported.
